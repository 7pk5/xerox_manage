### Problem: Long Queues and Inefficient Xerox Orders

We've all been there: standing in long queues, waiting for our turn to place a Xerox order. Whether you're a student with deadlines or a professional in need of urgent copies, the process can often feel outdated and inefficient.

**Here are some of the common issues faced:**
1. **Long waiting times**: Popular Xerox shops often have long lines, especially during peak hours.
2. **Miscommunication**: Handing over documents in person can sometimes lead to errors in copying, such as missing pages or unclear instructions.
3. **Inconvenient payment methods**: Physical payments often require cash, which can be a hassle in today's digital age.
4. **Limited time**: People with tight schedules may find it challenging to visit the shop, especially when it's out of the way or if they're juggling multiple tasks.
5. **Document privacy concerns**: Handing over sensitive documents in a public space might make some people uneasy about privacy and security.
